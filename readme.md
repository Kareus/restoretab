# RestoreTab

A very simple chrome extension for saving tabs.

### Introduction
I search many things in google for develop issues.
And there being so many tabs, so many search history, and so many popup links in history.
It disturbs me (even when I'm watching Youtube),
so I like to use secret mode when searching.

But I cannot restore tabs (Ctrl + Shift + T) in secret mode.
That's why I made this.

### Usage
You can restore a tab (or tabs).
Click the extension icon, or use right-click context menu to restore a tab.

- Restore Tab : restores one most-recently-closed tab.
- Restore Window : restores tabs from most-recently-closed window. (You can restore window by clicking the extension when there are no tabs created in a window.)
- Clear Tab History : clears tab history. (You can't restore tab in that window anymore)
- Clear Window History : clears window history. (You can't restore closed windows anymore)

### Actually
Well, there would be many better chrome extensions than this (tab manager or such).
Will I use? Not sure. I just made for fun and to practice web development.
Then why am I writing this?

Hmm.
Thanks.
